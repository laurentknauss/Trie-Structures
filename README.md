# **Binary Search Tree in Golang**<br>

This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Golang.<br>
The codebase demonstrates the basic operations of a BST, including insertion and in-order traversal.<br>
The implementation is simple, yet effective, and serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of BSTs.
<br>
<br>

**Features:**<br>
-Node structure to represent each node in the BST.<br>
-Insertion of nodes into the BST.<br>
-In-order traversal of the BST.<br>
In a nutshell :<br>
A node can have at most 2 child nodes . 
*One child node on the left , containing values less than the node .<br>
*One child node on the right , containing values greater than the node .<br> 
*A node can also have just one child, either on the left or either on the right .<br>
*A node can also have no children, it is then reffered as a 'leaf node '.<br> 




Here is a drawing of the binary search tree structure  for our particular case :<br>

*How to Run*<br>

Clone this repository to your local machine.<br>
Navigate to the directory containing the main.go file.<br>
Run  `go run main.go` .<br>
<br>

The output should be as follows : <br> 
<br>

`2 5 7 10 12 15 18`
