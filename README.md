**Binary Search Tree in Golang**

This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Golang.<br>
The codebase demonstrates the basic operations of a BST, including insertion and in-order traversal.<br>
The implementation is simple, yet effective, and serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of BSTs.
<br>


Features:<br>
-Node structure to represent each node in the BST.<br>
-Insertion of nodes into the BST.<br>
-In-order traversal of the BST.<br>

Here is a drawing of the binary search tree structure  for our particular case :<br>
