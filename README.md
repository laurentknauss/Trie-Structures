**Binary Search Tree in Golang**

This repository contains an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Golang.<br>

The codebase demonstrates the basic operations of a BST, including insertion and in-order traversal. The implementation is simple, yet effective, and serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of BSTs.

Features
Node structure to represent each node in the BST
Insertion of nodes into the BST
In-order traversal of the BST
